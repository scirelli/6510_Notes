 Error Message #50:  RECORD NOT PRESENT

  Result of disk reading past the last record through INPUT#, or GET#
  commands. This message will also occur after positioning to a record
  beyond end of file in a relative file.  If the intent is to expand the file
  by adding the new record (with a PRINT# command), the error message may be
  ignored. INPUT or GET should not be attempted after this error is detected
  without first repositioning.
