 Error Message #28:  WRITE ERROR (long data block)

  The controller attempts to detect the sync mark of the next header after
  writing a data block. If the sync mark does not appear within a
  predetermined time, the error message is generated. The error is caused by
  a bad diskette format (the data extends into the next block), or by
  hardware failure.
