The neccessary stuff...
------------------------

Though I tried to make this project as error-free as possible, I can't
guarantee that there aren't any mistakes left. So I am not responsible
for any loss of source-code or damaged hardware or anything else. If
you use it, you do it at your own risk!!
But now to something more pleasant. All_About_Your_64 (AAY64) is hereby
declared as FREEWARE. I still have the copyright for it, but you are
not only allowed but even asked to distribute it as long as you don't
want too much money for it (around $2). If you want to include it on a
CDROM, please give me a note. You can EMail me at: ninja@the-dreams.de

To get the newest AAY64, AAY1541 or AAY1581 in THELP-, HTML- or
ASCII-format, just check:

What is AAY64?
---------------
There was a time when it really annoyed me that the information I
needed for coding was very well scattered over different books which
were very well scatterd over my room. Because I was already using a
cross-assembler system, I got the idea of making an online-help as I
knew them from different PC-programming-languages. After a little
research work I found out that Borland's THELP was the tool to use,
but then a request for a HTML-version came and since it wasn't too
difficult to convert, I agreed. Of course, at the beginning this project
was pretty small. I only included the stuff I always forget. But over the
years I managed to include this and that idea so it's now at the present
state. Sure, it's far away from being perfect or complete or anything, but
I release this version now, cause it might help one or another people doing
nice stuff for our favourite computer, the C64! If you want some special
info being added or found a bug, please let me know. This project became
too large for me to maintain it on my own. You may also write, if you are
simply using AAY64 and want to encourage me. :)

Installing AAY64
-----------------
This one is very simple. Unzip the AAY64.ZIP-archive into one directory
(be warned: there are 1000+ files!), start your favourite
browser and load from your AAY64-directory the INDEX.HTM-startpage.
Have fun! :)

A word to those 1000+ files: I know that there is a huge waste on
harddisks using big clusters, but the advantage is that you can
convert these HTML-files to another helpfile-format without losing the
original structure. In my opinion this has priority...


Greetings
----------
I want to thank all the people who released textfiles describing C64
specifications, so I could use them as my basics. If I had to translate
everything into English on my own, this project would have taken
centuries... I'd like to give you specific credits, but in most cases
there was no name given. But your work was very important, so again
'Thank you'!

Also thanks to Brix/Plush for the idea of the HTML-version.

And now go on coding (perhaps with the help of AAY64)...
