   (*)  Loop Back Test means data from the Transmit Shift Register is
        received in the Receiver Shift Register. The SOUT line is set to
        logic high, the SIN line and control lines are disconnected. CTS,
        DSR, RI and CD inputs are disconnected. DTR, RTS, OUT1 and OUT2
        are then connected internally.
