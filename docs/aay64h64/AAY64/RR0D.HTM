 $DE0D/56845/RR+13:  SilverSurfer: Line Status Register (read only)

   +-------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | Bit 7 |   1 = PE/FE/Break in FIFO queue                        |
   | Bit 6 |   1 = Transmitter Shift Register empty (TSRE)          |
   | Bit 5 |   1 = Transmitter Holding Register empty (THRE)        |
   | Bit 4 |   1 = Break Interrupt (BI)                             |
   | Bit 3 |   1 = Framing Error (FE)                               |
   | Bit 2 |   1 = Parity Error (PE)                                |
   | Bit 1 |   1 = Overrun Error (OE)                               |
   | Bit 0 |   1 = Data Ready                                       |

   Bit 0 is set when a byte is placed in <A HREF="RR08.HTM">$DE08</A> and cleared when the
   byte is read by the CPU or when the FIFO is cleared. Results in Data
   Available Interrupts if enabled.

   Bits 1-4 indicate errors and result in Line Status Interrupts if enabled.

     Bit 1 is set when the queue is full and the byte in the Receiver Shift
     Register hasn't been moved into the queue. This bit is reset when the
     CPU reads the LSR.

     Bit 2 is set whenever a byte at top of the FIFO queue doesn't match the
     requested parity. Reset upon reading the LSR.

     Bit 3 is set when a character at top of the FIFO queue is received
     without proper stop bits. Upon detecting a framing error the UART
     attempts to resynchronize. Reset by reading the LSR.

     Bit 4 is set when a break condition is sensed (when space is
     detected for longer than 1 fullword).  A zero byte is placed in
     the FIFO queue. Reset by reading the LSR.

   Bit 5 is set when the XMIT FIFO queue is empty and is cleared when a byte
   is written to the XMIT FIFO. Results in Transmit Holding Register Empty
   interrupts if enabled.

   Bit 6 is set when the XMIT FIFO and Transmitter Shift Register are empty.

   Bit 7 indicates there is a byte in the FIFO queue that was received with
   a Parity, Framing or Break error.
