  | <A HREF="ADDR24A.HTM">Block Positive</A> |   MVP $FF,$FF         |   $44   |    3    |  7/byte  |
  +----------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+----------+
   X-Register = Source Address
   Y-Register = Destination Address
   Accumulator = Number of Bytes to move -1
   $FF,$FF = Source Bank, Destination Bank

   <B>Attention: In memory the order of the Bank-bytes is the other way
   around (i.e. Dest, Src)! Some assemblers use this order as syntax,
   although it is not correct.

   Keep also in mind that the Data-Bank-Register will be set to Dest-Bank.</B>

   MVP is used when the destination start address is higher (more positive)
   than the source start address.
