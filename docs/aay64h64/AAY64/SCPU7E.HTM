 $D07E/53374/SCPU+14:   Hardware Register Enable

   This register is write only, active with hardware registers enabled
   or disabled.

   <B>IMPORTANT NOTE: Enabling the SuperCPU hardware registers also
   causes some changes in the Kernal ROM memory map ($E000-$FFFF).
   To avoid problems, do not leave the hardware registers enabled
   any longer than necessary.</B>
